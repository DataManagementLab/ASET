Aviation Dataset
================

The aviation dataset consists of the executive summaries of the NTSB Aviation Accident Reports:
https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/aviation.aspx

The texts have been annotated with information about where they mention the structured values.

Each entry of the dataset is a json file of the following structure:
{
    "id": "<id of the document>",
    "text": "<summary of the report>",
    "mentions": {
        "<attribute name>": [
            {
            "start_char": <position of the first character of the mention>,
            "end_char": <position of the first character after the mention>
            }    # for each mention of the attribute in the text
        ]  # for each attribute
    },
    "mentions_same_attribute_class": {
        #  same as "mentions", but with mentions of the same attribute class (e.g. city), but not the desired value
    }
}  # for each document
