Skyscrapers Dataset
===================

The skyscrapers dataset consists of articles about skyscrapers from the T-Rex dataset:
https://hadyelsahar.github.io/t-rex/

The texts have been annotated with information about where they mention the structured values.

Each entry of the dataset is a json file of the following structure:
{
    "id": "<id of the document>",
    "text": "<article>",
    "mentions": {
        "<attribute name>": [
            {
            "start_char": <position of the first character of the mention>,
            "end_char": <position of the first character after the mention>
            }    # for each mention of the attribute in the text
        ]  # for each attribute
    },
    "mentions_same_attribute_class": {
        #  same as "mentions", but with mentions of the same attribute class (e.g. city), but not the desired value
    }
}  # for each document
